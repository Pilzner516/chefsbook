# DONE.md - Completed Features & Changes
# Updated automatically at every Claude Code session wrap.

## 2026-04-06 (session 2)
- Import pipeline waterfall: JSON-LD first → Claude gap-fill → Claude-only fallback; `import_status` + `missing_sections` + `aichef_assisted` fields on recipes
- aiChef completion system: `generateAiChefSuggestion()` in `@chefsbook/ai` for suggesting missing recipe sections with user review
- Shopping list store navigation: two-level hierarchy (stores → items), smart deduplication with quantity merging
- Meal plan editing: inline edit, remove meal, smart cart sync UI (synced_to_list_id/synced_at/synced_ingredients_hash on meal_plans)
- Fixed TypeScript crash: made new DB fields optional (`?:`) on MealPlan and Recipe interfaces — required fields without values caused "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- Emulator debugging: identified Metro hostname issue (Tailscale IP vs localhost), fixed with `REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=localhost`
- Documented reliable emulator launch: must use CLI with `-no-snapshot -gpu host`, not Android Studio Device Manager

## 2026-04-06 (session 1)
- Fixed Android build: added android.enableJetifier=true to resolve androidx/support-compat duplicate class conflict
- Redesigned mobile Scan/Import tab: hero Speak button with pulse animation, 2x2 icon grid, collapsible URL input, clipboard paste helper, Chrome share banner
- Registered ChefsBook as Android share target (intent filters for VIEW http/https + SEND text/plain in app.json)
- Added expo-linking handler in _layout.tsx for incoming shared URLs with auto-import
- Installed expo-clipboard for paste-from-clipboard workflow
- Created .claude/agents/navigator.md — full screen map (17 mobile + 18 web screens, ADB coordinates, components, stores)
- Created .claude/agents/wrapup.md — end-of-session navigator update check
- Added Navigator Agent section to root CLAUDE.md and apps/mobile/agents/CLAUDE.md

## 2026-04-05 (session 5)
- Fixed recipe detail notes rendering: paragraph splitting on newlines and labeled sections (e.g. "Rub:", "Sauce:"), proper line spacing and margins
- Shopping list item layout overhaul: purchase unit as prominent left element in accent red (`colors.accent`), usage amount in green (`colors.accentGreen`) below item name, removed green "Buy:" label
- Shopping list font size control: 3 sizes (Small/Medium/Large) with `A`/`A+`/`A++` cycle toggle in header, persisted via `expo-secure-store`
- ADB verified: Red purchase units and green usage amounts display correctly
- ADB verified: Font size toggle visible in header, cycling through Small → Medium → Large works with visible text scaling

## 2026-04-05 (session 4)
- Mobile tag management on recipe detail: TagManager component with add/remove tag pills (accentSoft bg, pomodoro red text), inline text input, AI auto-tag via `callClaude` from `@chefsbook/ai`
- Auto-tag sends recipe title, cuisine, ingredients, steps to Claude and returns 5-8 suggested tags as green dashed pills; tap to add
- Tag sanitization: lowercase, no special characters, no duplicates
- ADB verified: Tags section renders on recipe detail with Auto-tag + Add Tag buttons
- ADB verified: Manual tag add ("bbq" pill with × remove button), tag removal (reverts to empty state)
- ADB verified: Auto-tag AI returns 7 suggestions (pork, ribs, oven-baked, barbecue, tender, american, comfort-food) as green dashed pills
- ADB verified: Tags persist to Supabase and sync to web (confirmed via REST API query)

## 2026-04-05 (session 3)
- Fixed React hooks violation in shop.tsx — useMemo calls were after early return, causing "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" crash when navigating back from list detail to list overview
- ADB verified: Shop tab loads correctly, "Week of 2026-03-30" list shows 41 items with department grouping (Produce, Meat & Seafood, Dairy & Eggs, Baking, Pasta & Grains, Canned & Jarred, Condiments & Sauces, Spices & Seasonings) and purchase units
- ADB verified: Navigate back from list detail → list overview — no crash (hooks fix confirmed)
- Web app shop page verified loading (HTTP 200) — same data via shared Supabase backend
- Committed 98-file batch covering all features from sessions 1-3

## 2026-04-05 (session 2)
- Mobile shopping list overhaul: shared `addItemsWithPipeline()` pipeline in `@chefsbook/db` (single source of truth for web + mobile)
- Mobile shopping UI: 3 view modes (Dept/Recipe/A-Z), 13 department groupings, inline quantity editing, manual item add, check/delete/clear completed
- Mobile recipe editing: inline edit mode with per-ingredient row editor (qty/unit/name, add/remove), per-step textarea, save/cancel
- Recipe-to-shopping integration: "Add to Shopping List" calls AI `suggestPurchaseUnits` + shared pipeline, shows "X new, Y merged" result
- Fixed Voice module crash in speak.tsx (lazy `require()` with try/catch instead of static import)
- Refactored web `add-items` API route to use shared `addItemsWithPipeline` from `@chefsbook/db`
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions for shopping lists and items in mobile store
- TypeScript compiles clean for both mobile and web

## 2026-04-05
- Android dev client built and running on emulator-5554 (npx expo run:android)
- Fixed JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME, DuplicateRelativeFileException (AndroidX vs support lib), React 19.1.4 frozen objects crash, duplicate react-native in Metro bundle
- Pinned React to 19.1.0 across monorepo (root overrides + web package.json)
- Added Metro blockList to prevent root node_modules react/react-native from bundling
- Landing screen with ChefsBook branding (cream bg, serif logo, sign in/create account)
- Sign in screen (email/password, Supabase auth, error handling, Google OAuth stub)
- Sign up screen (name/email/password, validation, Supabase auth, Google OAuth stub)
- Auth protection: useProtectedRoute() hook in root layout + guard in tab layout
- Removed anonymous auth — app shows landing when unauthenticated
- adb reverse port forwarding for emulator ↔ host Metro/Supabase connectivity

## 2026-03-31
- Fix: meal planner shopping list aggregation — recipes appearing multiple times now multiply ingredient quantities by occurrence count (addWeekToShoppingList + addDayToShoppingList)
- Confirmed recipe detail servings scaling to shopping list was already correct (no fix needed)
- CLAUDE.md cleanup: removed stale session history, resolved known issues, deduplicated decisions log, expanded API routes table (8 → 17)
- Added Substack integration to AGENDA.md backlog (Tier 4)

- Meal planner overhaul: smart recipe picker panel (slide-in, filters, favourites/all tabs), notes on day cards (amber sticky-note style), two-row calendar layout (Mon-Fri / Sat-Sun), recipe images on day cards

- Sidebar overhaul: extracted shared Sidebar component, collapsible with hamburger toggle, recipe/technique counts, reordered nav (Search → Recipes → Techniques → Cookbooks → Discover → Shopping → Meal Plan → Import & Scan → Speak a Recipe), Settings at bottom
- Sidebar on recipe/technique pages: layout wrappers show sidebar for authenticated users
- Sidebar fixed height: `h-screen sticky top-0 overflow-y-auto` — no more stretching with content
