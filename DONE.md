# DONE.md - Completed Features & Changes
# Updated automatically at every Claude Code session wrap.

## 2026-04-05 (session 2)
- Mobile shopping list overhaul: shared `addItemsWithPipeline()` pipeline in `@chefsbook/db` (single source of truth for web + mobile)
- Mobile shopping UI: 3 view modes (Dept/Recipe/A-Z), 13 department groupings, inline quantity editing, manual item add, check/delete/clear completed
- Mobile recipe editing: inline edit mode with per-ingredient row editor (qty/unit/name, add/remove), per-step textarea, save/cancel
- Recipe-to-shopping integration: "Add to Shopping List" calls AI `suggestPurchaseUnits` + shared pipeline, shows "X new, Y merged" result
- Fixed Voice module crash in speak.tsx (lazy `require()` with try/catch instead of static import)
- Refactored web `add-items` API route to use shared `addItemsWithPipeline` from `@chefsbook/db`
- Supabase Realtime subscriptions for shopping lists and items in mobile store
- TypeScript compiles clean for both mobile and web

## 2026-04-05
- Android dev client built and running on emulator-5554 (npx expo run:android)
- Fixed JAVA_HOME, ANDROID_HOME, DuplicateRelativeFileException (AndroidX vs support lib), React 19.1.4 frozen objects crash, duplicate react-native in Metro bundle
- Pinned React to 19.1.0 across monorepo (root overrides + web package.json)
- Added Metro blockList to prevent root node_modules react/react-native from bundling
- Landing screen with ChefsBook branding (cream bg, serif logo, sign in/create account)
- Sign in screen (email/password, Supabase auth, error handling, Google OAuth stub)
- Sign up screen (name/email/password, validation, Supabase auth, Google OAuth stub)
- Auth protection: useProtectedRoute() hook in root layout + guard in tab layout
- Removed anonymous auth — app shows landing when unauthenticated
- adb reverse port forwarding for emulator ↔ host Metro/Supabase connectivity

## 2026-03-31
- Fix: meal planner shopping list aggregation — recipes appearing multiple times now multiply ingredient quantities by occurrence count (addWeekToShoppingList + addDayToShoppingList)
- Confirmed recipe detail servings scaling to shopping list was already correct (no fix needed)
- CLAUDE.md cleanup: removed stale session history, resolved known issues, deduplicated decisions log, expanded API routes table (8 → 17)
